## Branching & Workflow

We follow a strict `main`/`dev` split:

* `main`: Always stable and production-ready.
* `dev`: Active development. **All pull requests must target `dev`**.

## Code Standards

* Use modern JavaScript / TypeScript.
* Prefer **clarity over cleverness**.
* Include **JSDoc** for exported functions and non-trivial logic.
* Follow our configured ESLint and Prettier rules:

  ```bash
  npm run lint
  npm run format
  ```

## Commit Conventions

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to label commits:

```
feat: add post sorting by score
fix: prevent crash on empty comments
docs: update README with setup steps
```

* Mention browser, OS, or Node version if relevant.

### Feature Requests

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork and create a branch off of `dev`.
2. Make your changes.
3. Run tests and linter:

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm test
   ```
4. Open a PR **into `dev`** with a clear title and description.
